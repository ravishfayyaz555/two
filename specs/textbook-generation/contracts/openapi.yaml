        Submit a natural language question to the RAG chatbot. The system will:
        1. Generate an embedding for the question
        2. Search Qdrant for top-5 most similar content chunks
        3. Re-rank results and select top-3
        4. Return answer with source citations

        **Rate Limit**: 10 requests per minute per IP address.

        **Response Time**: p95 <2 seconds, p50 <1 second.
